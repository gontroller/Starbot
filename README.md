## 🎯 Project Objective

**Collab Stars** is the most complete Discord bot boilerplate available — built with TypeScript and designed for performance, scalability, and collaborative development.

It was created to:

- Provide a **scalable and extensible base** for Discord bots.
- Simplify bot development using **modular, typed, and documented** code.
- Integrate seamlessly with the tools and workflows developed by the [Collab Stars](https://github.com/CollabStars) organization.

---

## 🧰 Technologies

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20.12+
- **Frameworks & Tools:**
  - [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) v14+
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
  - [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
  - [TSup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) for bundling

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a clean, layered architecture inspired by modern backend practices:

- **⚙️ Command System**  
  Slash commands are defined modularly and auto-registered on startup.

- **🎙️ Event Layer**  
  All event listeners (e.g., `messageCreate`, `interactionCreate`) are handled independently.

- **📡 Responders System**  
  Custom message responders allow dynamic reactions to specific content.

- **📁 Structured Filesystem**  
  Organized with clear folders: `commands/`, `events/`, `responders/`, `utils/`, etc.
