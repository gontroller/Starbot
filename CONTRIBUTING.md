# 📜 Contribution Guidelines - Collab Stars!

This document defines the rules and workflow so that everyone can collaborate in an organized and safe way.

---

## 🔒 Security & Branches
- **Never** push directly to the `main` or `develop` branches.
- All changes must go through a **Pull Request (PR)**.
- **Forbidden** to approve and merge your own PRs.
- Branch naming convention:


/* feature/feature-name */
/* fix/bug-description */
/* chore/maintenance-task */

- Always keep your branch up-to-date with `main` before opening a PR.

---

## 🛠 Pull Request Workflow
1. Create your branch from `develop`.
2. Write clear and objective commits (`feat: moderation command`, `fix: responder error`).
3. Open a PR to `develop` with a **complete description** of your changes.
4. Wait for a review from **at least one other collaborator**.
5. Only reviewers with merge permissions can approve and merge PRs.

---

## 📏 Code Standards
- Follow the project's configured **ESLint/Prettier** rules.
- Do not push commented-out code or temporary test code.
- Avoid creating duplicate functions or commands.
- Respect the established typings and project structures.

---

## 💬 Communication
- Use the **Issues** tab to report bugs or suggest features.
- Before starting something new, confirm if no one else is already working on it.
- Be clear in your commit messages and PR descriptions.

> ⚠ **Note:** Breaking these rules may result in temporary loss of repository access.
